        <h1>Bridgelabz is cool</h1>
        <img src="" alt="Hover Text." width="30%">

        <p>Bridgelabz is a very professional IT giant, provides skillful employable developers to the company.
            One thing that i personally don't like about Bridgelabz is that, companies try to make bond with fresher
            students, who are ready to accept any condition because of their desperate need of job.

        <ul>
            <li>Technologist</li>
            <li>Thinkers</li>
            <li>Builders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Again we have to mention another paragraph, where we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of corperate world
            which seems to be very sophisticated, tidy and clean later people realize that they have made a huge mistake. But speaking
            of me i love coding and i am ready to learn newer technologies as per the requirement!
